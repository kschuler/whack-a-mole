This is the whack-a-mole paradigm

## Things to do
- add flexibility for having more exposures and tests (including parameters for those)
  - you definitely want to use condition files (easier for people)
  - any number of exposure files 
  - any number of test files
- add flexibility for data 
  - make sure the data is sampling everything you want it to
- figure out a better way to add flexiblity for instructions files
  - maybe a text file?
